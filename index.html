                <h1>Everyone knows that government spying is out of control. Chelsea Manning has a real proposal to address it.</h1>
            

            

            

            <p>Right now, politicians are making decisions that will affect the future of our freedom of expression and basic human rights. The U.S. government's unpopular mass surveillance programs have been heavily criticized, but so far Congress has failed to meaningfully curtail them, and is even moving to expand them through legislation like the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA.)</p>
<p>What the world needs right now is for smart people who actually understand how these programs work to chime in and offer real solutions for how to rein them in.</p>
<p>Chelsea Manning, the Wikileaks whistleblower who exposed some of the U.S. government's worst abuses, was an Army intelligence analyst before she was locked away with an unjust 35 year sentence. She understands how these programs work and has a unique perspective as someone who gets how the actual people who use this data think.</p>
<p>Chelsea has written a 129 page surveillance reform bill that EVERYONE should read, but most importantly we should encourage the members of Congress who are supposed to represent us to read it and take it into consideration as they move to address these issues. The bill starts by abolishing the secretive and controversial Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, and it also includes a proposed alternative to CISA.</p>
<p>Check out Chelsea's column in The Guardian about the bill, and make sure to sign the petition asking your lawmakers to read it. They might learn something!</p>

                <h1>This sounds like a joke, but it&#39;s not. Here are the facts:</h1>
            

            

            

            <p>Chelsea Manning, the Guardian columnist and whistleblower responsible for one of WikiLeaks most important <a href="https://collateralmurder.wikileaks.org/">releases</a>, has been in jail for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/27/anniversary-chelsea-manning-arrest-war-diaries">five years</a> facing an unjust 35 year sentence for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/21/bradley-manning-35-years-prison-wikileaks-sentence">exposing</a> some of the U.S. governments worst abuses.</p>
<p><b>Now, Chelsea is being threatened with <i>indefinite solitary confinement</i>, and the "charges" against her demonstrate that her basic human rights are being violated.</b> Chelsea requested that her hearing be made open to the public, but officials refused.</p>
<p>BREAKING UPDATE: With just two days left before she has to present her defense in front the disciplinary board, prison staff are now <a href="https://twitter.com/xychelsea/status/632720934688944128">denying Chelsea access to the facility's legal library.</a></p>
<p>Chelsea's alleged "crimes" include: sweeping some food onto the floor and then asking to speak to her lawyer when a guard confronted her, having books and magazines in her cell about politics and LGBTQ issues including the Vanity Fair issue with Caitlyn Jenner on the cover, and "improper medicine use" <i>for having a tube of toothpaste that was past its expiration date.</i></p>
<p><b>It couldn't be more blatant: Chelsea is being singled out and punished for speaking out.</b></p>
<p>Chelsea is a human being. She did something brave and now the government is punishing her for it. It's not just Chelsea's basic rights that are at stake, it's all of ours. Please sign the petition, and then share it on social media. <b>This couldn't be more urgent; the hearing is just days away. If it's not open to the public and the press, there will be no way to ensure that Chelsea isn't unfairly subjected to one of the worst forms of psychological torture.</b></p>

                <h1>Here are the actual &quot;charges&quot; that Chelsea faces indefinite solitary confinement for:</h1>
            

            

            

            <p>Below is an actual list of the "charges" that were sent to Chelsea (emphasis added). Even if everything the prison claims is 100% true, there's no way this would justify putting anyone in indefinite solitary confinement.</p>
<p><center><img src="https://fftf-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/manning_charges5.png"></center></p>
<p>UPDATE: Chelsea has posted the official charging documents on her twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/xychelsea/status/631953441779138561">here</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/xychelsea/status/631954178332487680">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>Here's <a href="https://twitter.com/xychelsea/status/632247137112207360">the list</a> of books and magazines that were taken from Chelsea and not returned:</b> Vanity Fair issue with Caitlyn Jenner on the cover, Advocate, OUT Magazine, Cosmopolitan issue with an interview of Chelsea, Transgender Studies Quarterly, novel about trans issues "A Safe Girl to Love," book "Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy -- The Many Faces of Anonymous," book "I Am Malala," 5 books by Robert Dorkin, legal documents including the Senate Torture Report, book: "Hidden Qualities that Make Us Influential."</p>
<p>None of these books or magazines should be considered contraband, nor do they pose a danger to anyone. It's terrifying that the U.S. government would target a prisoner so unfairly with so little justification.</p>
<p>Longterm solitary confinement is <a href="https://ccrjustice.org/home/get-involved/tools-resources/fact-sheets-and-faqs/torture-use-solitary-confinement-us-prisons">a form of torture</a>. No one deserves this cruel and unusual psychological punishment, especially not a whistleblower like Chelsea Manning who many people believe should not be in prison <a href="https://www.chelseamanning.org">in the first place</a>.</p>

            <p>Chelsea has been very active while in prison, speaking out through her <a href="https://www.twitter.com/xychelsea">twitter account</a> about issues of government transparency, transgender rights, and the prison system. She's been writing a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chelsea-manning">regular column</a> for The Guardian, and even <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/07/chelsea-manning-bill-journalism-espionage-act">wrote a bill</a> to reform the Espionage Act and protect journalism.</p>
<p>These absurd charges against Chelsea, and the outrageous threat of indefinite solitary confinement, are clearly an attempt to silence Chelsea's important voice and cut her off from the outside world.</p>
<p>We have to make sure this attempt to silence Chelsea not only fails, but backfires. <b>Share this petition right now</b> to let the U.S. government know that the whole world is watching, and we won't stand by while they jail and torture whistleblowers who stand up for democracy and free speech.</p>
<p>Please sign and share the petition, and if you can, <a href="https://freedom.press/chelsea">click here to chip in to Chelsea's legal defense fund</a> to support her appeal!</p>
